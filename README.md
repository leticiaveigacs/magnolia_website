# Magnolia Florist Project ðŸŒ¸

The central objective of this project was the development of a commercial website, aiming to offer customers a comprehensive and intuitive online experience for purchasing flowers and related activities.

## UML Diagram ðŸ“Š

A UML diagram was implemented to represent the case study of the website. This proved to be essential as the tool enabled structured and detailed mapping of the system. It highlighted the involved actors, including customers and the florist itself, by defining essential functionalities such as event requests, flower orders, and payments, and consolidating the relationships between these elements.

## Structure ðŸ’»

The main page of the website showcases a list of flowers with detailed photos and descriptions. It provides relevant information about the services offered by the florist. 
There are three sub-pages: "About Us," "Services," and "Contacts." These enhance the user experience by providing additional information about the brand, its products, pricing, and contact methods via a form.
